			<p class="center">Hello! Thank you for visiting my site and giving me an opportunity to present myself to you. To start off, I’d like to give you a quick background on myself. I was born in San Antonio, Texas but am originally from Medellin, Colombia and lived there for the first four years of my life. I then moved to McAllen, Texas, a small town in the southern tip of Texas, and lived there until I went to college. I am currently a junior at Texas A&M University in College Station where I am majoring in Computer Science. </p>
			<p class="center">I am driven on a daily basis by my passions for computer science and business/entrepreneurship. I believe that my interests in computer science and business combined with my desire to always keep growing and learning will help me develop the necessary skills and character to be able to start and run my own company one day that will change the world for the better.</p>
			<p class="center">My current goal is to get an internship for summer 2018 with a tech company as a software engineer.

	<h1> Online eBay Business </h1>
	<h6> June 2013 - Present </h6>
	<h4> Overview </h4>
	<p>With the help of 3 employees and a freelancer, my business has managed to achieve more than $275,000 in sales over the course of 4 years. What started off as a small money-making experiment has now turned into a systematized operation that has set me financially free.</p>
	<br><h4> Experience </h4>
    <p>My eBay business has been a remarkable learning experience that has helped me develop a variety of invaluable skills such as business development, through the design of efficient systems, and leadership skills by learning how to effectively manage 3 employees and a freelancer. The 3 employees (who are friends) take hold of all the inventory and are in charge of shipping out packages for all orders. The freelance contract worker is a person from India who is in mainly in charge of customer service but also performs any task that I consider to be delegable. Having the freelancer in my work force has been a complete game changer in terms of customer satisfaction, due to prompt replies throughout the day, and in saving me time by being able to delegate any task that does not require a high skill level. As a result, rather than having to invest my time into the maintenance of the business, I can now focus on its growth, where it has become critical to designing systems for automatic decision making. By removing myself from the operational maintenance of the business, I am making a transition from a business operator to a business owner. This means that I can continue to have a profitable and lucrative business without having to spend as much time on it. I now spend an average of about 30 minutes or less every day on the business while maintaining monthly sales of about $8,000 to $12,000 with around 500 to 700 items sold.</p>
	<p>Being critically analytical of the processes in my business has taught me to be more analytical of myself. I’ve learned that every second and cent saved may appear to be minimal in the short term, but over longer periods of time the effect is extremely significant due to the concept of compounding. In this way, I’ve learned to better identify inefficiencies in my life and designed solutions, habits, or routines to amend them.</p>
	<p>I re-invest almost all of the money that I make back into the business in order to compound its growth. This business is the only investment I currently have due to its high returns and low risk. However, as my net worth continues to grow, I am beginning to look into other avenues of investment such as Amazon, real estate, stock investment, and investment in my own ideas. </p>

	<h6> January 2011 - Present </h6>
	
	<h4> Overview </h4>
    <p>Ever since I discovered my passion for programming, developing iOS applications became an enjoyable hobby. I have since published 4 applications on the app store and am currently working to complete my 5th. Cumulatively, all my applications have been downloaded over 30,000 times.</p>
	<br><h4> Experience </h4>
	<p>I discovered my passion for programming when I was first introduced to it in 8th grade (2011). One of my dad’s friends, who is a computer scientist, noticed my fascination for technology and offered to build an app with him for iOS. With much excitement at the thought of learning a skill that would allow me to build any application that I could use on my phone, I accepted his offer without hesitation. We began to work on a calculator application for the iPad because when the iPad first came out in 2010, it did not come with a calculator. Developing the calculator was a life changing experience that instilled a sincere passion for programming. I became fascinated by the challenge of analyzing a situation or process to identify areas for improvement, employing creativity to develop a software solution, and publishing the software to make it readily available to billions of users worldwide. <strong>I then realized that programming is not just a tool - it is a platform for enacting meaningful change.</strong> </p>
	<p>I have since developed and published 3 additional applications on the app store. Here is a brief description on each.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>iCalculator Pro</h4>
	<h5>June 2011 - January 2012</h5>
	<img class="leftModalImages" src="Resources/icalculatorproicon.png" alt="" target="_blank">
	<p>After developing the first calculator application with my dad’s friend, which only had basic adding, subtracting, multiplication, and division functions, I decided to develop a calculator with advanced scientific functionality. Taking what I had learned from the first calculator and furthering my understanding of programming by watching video tutorials and reading application development books, I managed to develop a scientific calculator with customizable themes.</p>

	<p>Widgets in Tabs is an application that was built for a personal project in high school, where students were allowed to build or do anything that would require significant time investment and end up with a final product. The concept of widgets in tabs is to have a place where you could see all the information you need in one place. For example, on a daily basis, most of us check Facebook, Twitter, email, and many other things. Widgets in Tabs provides 5 different tabs in which you can chose to display a widget (Facebook, Twitter, email, or currency exchange). Each of these widgets would display the most important information from that widget. For example, Facebook would tell you how many new notifications and messages you have. As a result of developing Widgets In Tabs, <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_913b1c88-be96-11e2-8093-001a4bcf6878.html" target="_blank" ><u><strong>I made the headline of my local newspaper in McAllen, TX.</u></strong></a></p>

	<h4>Texas Lyceum</h4>

	<p>After discovering me through a McAllen ISD board meeting that mentioned my name for the development of Widgets In Tabs, Susan Valverde, a member of the Texas Lyceum, contacted me to develop an application for an upcoming meeting the Texas Lyceum was having in McAllen. I worked collaboratively with Susan to plan out the layout of the application and to ensure that the application was up to her standards of quality. The app was a successful hit at the meeting and the Texas Lyceum contracted me two additional times to develop applications for their quarterly meetings.</p>

    <h1> Website Development </h1>
	<h6> June 2012 - Present </h6>
	<h4> Overview </h4>
    <p>I find web development to be fascinating because with HTML and CSS’s ease of use, I can focus on how to best design the website to attract the user’s attention. With the completion of this website, I have now designed and developed 3 websites for various purposes. </p>
	<br>
	<h4> Experience </h4>
	<p>When I first started learning how to develop websites using HTML and CSS I was very relieved to find out it was not nearly as difficult as traditional programming languages. I took a course on Udemy for Web Development and learned the necessary skills to develop elegant websites.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>JEAR Development</h4>
	<h5>June 2012 - August 2012</h5>
	<a href="http://www.jeardev.com/" target="_blank"><img id="jearLogo" src="Resources/jearlogoSmall.png" alt="" target="_blank"></a>
	<p>JEAR Development is a brand that I created for the various applications I have developed. I developed a website for JEAR Development to have a place where people can see all the different applications I have developed.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>TACG</h4>
	<h5>July 2017 - August 2017</h5>
	<a href="http://www.tamuconsultinggroup.org" target="_blank"><img class="leftModalImages" src="Resources/tacgLogo2.png" alt="" target="_blank"></a>
	<p>As the Director of Technology for the Texas A&M Consulting Group, my first big project was to develop a website for the organization. I decided to develop this website using WordPress even though I knew how to use CSS and HTML to save myself some time by starting off with an elegant template and to get myself familiar with WordPress’s powerful and interactive platform. The website also didn’t require complicated functionality so developing it with WordPress was not a major issue.</p>

	<h1> Texas A&M Consulting Group </h1>
	<h6> April 2017 - Present </h6>
	<h4> Overview </h4>
	<p>Texas A&M Consulting Group is a student-organized group that aims to service and improve the operational standing of locally based Texas A&M organizations. I am one of the co-founders and serve as the Director of Technology, where I have worked on website development and project management.</p>
	<br><h4> Experience </h4>
	<p>Being one of the co-founders of TACG has given me the unique opportunity of experiencing the development of the organization since its inception. Starting from the ground up has been a difficult process that has challenged me to think about the best ways of establishing the systems and processes in place to be most effective and efficient in our consulting service. We are still fairly new but have already begun to work with our first round of clients. The officers and I have established an ideal protocol for the step-to-step process we should take in serving our clients. However, being that we have not put all of these processes into practice yet, it will be extremely critical to be analytical of how effective each process is and to determine if the order in which they are executed is optimal.</p>

	<h1> Tony Robbins Seminars </h1>
	<h6> November 2016, January 2017 </h6>
	<h4> Overview </h4>
    <p>Tony Robbins is an entrepreneur, best-selling author, philanthropist, and a world-renowned life and business strategist. I consider him to be my greatest mentor because of the profound impact he’s had on my life. I have attended 2 of his seminars in the last year on business and life mastery.</p>
	<br><h4> Influence </h4>
	<p>The amount of influence that Tony Robbins has had on my life since I discovered him a year ago has been insanely profound. Since the time I attended my first seminar last November, my personal growth and development has been exponential. Tony is a master of psychology and human behavior. He understands why people behave in the ways that they do and has extensively studied the reasons and factors that lead to a person’s success or failure. He conducts several different types of seminars every year where he teaches a countless number of invaluable concepts. </p>
	<p>I have always been an ambitious person by nature but I never felt that I was doing what was necessary to accomplish the immense magnitude of my goals until I discovered Tony. I can without a doubt say that he has awakened the Giant within me.</p>
	<p>One of the most important beliefs I hold is that the best investment I can make is an investment in my personal development. Thus, I used business profits to finance my attendance to two of Tony’s seminars. Here is a brief description on both of these events.</p>
  	<br>
	<h4>Unleash The Power Within</h4>
	<h5>San Jose, California | November 2016</h5>
	<p>Unleash the Power Within is a 4 day event with Tony designed to help you unlock and unleash the forces inside that can help you break through any limit and create the quality of life you desire. My first seminar with Tony taught me how to master my psychology and helped me define a guideline for how to achieve all my ambitious goals.</p>
	<p>I also learned about the importance of health and how it has a direct correlation to well-being, high energy levels, and optimal brain cognition. I have since studied health extensively because I now understand that optimal health results in increased energy and focus, which helps me to improve all the other areas of my life. In essence, optimal health is a form of buying time and prolonging the beautiful thrill of life.</p>
 	<br>
	<h4>Business Mastery</h4>
	<h5>Palm Beach, Florida | January 2017</h5>
	<p>Business Mastery is a fully immersive 5 day event where Tony and other speakers help you understand the critical factors impacting your business right now, allowing you to refocus and realign with the business strategy and psychology you need for competing and innovating in any economy. I learned so many fundamental concepts and strategies that will be applicable with any business I have now and in the future.</p>
	<p>One of the most important concepts I learned, that I have already implemented in my business, was the importance of making the transition from a business operator to a business owner. Even though I had employees at the time that were in charge of shipping out all the packages for sold items, I was still doing a lot of work that didn’t require a high skill level such as: replying to customer concerns/questions, creating listings for new items, updating prices, ect. After realizing that these were low-level tasks that could be performed by almost anyone, I found and hired a freelancer from Dehli, India that is in charge of performing all of these tasks. The best part is that I only pay him $5 / hour since the hourly wage in India is much lower than the US. Hiring this freelancer has bought me enormous amounts of times that I can now invest into things of higher value.</p>

    <h1> Mobile App Development </h1>
	<h6> September 2015 - April 2016 </h6>
	<h4> Overview </h4>
    <p>Mobile App Development is a student organization at UT Austin that creates an environment for learning app development with workshops, hack nights, and other events. As a member, I attended events for learning Java and iOS development, where I constantly collaborated with others on projects.</p>
	<br><h4> Experience </h4>
	<p>During my first year of college at UT Austin, I joined MAD and began to attend weekly workshops, hack nights, and other events for iOS and Android development. The workshops were fun and engaging because the student instructors were good at teaching and consistently picked fun projects to work on for practice. In particular, I really enjoyed completing one of the projects where we had to build a calculator application for Android because I had already made a calculator for iOS. </p>
	<p>This organization provided me the opportunity of collaborating with others on programming projects for the first time during the hack night events. As a result, I learned how to use GitHub to collaborate with others on a project effectively. It was a really interesting and valuable experience because all of my prior programming had been done individually. Additionally, I got to network with a lot of other intelligent students that shared a similar passion for programming!</p>
